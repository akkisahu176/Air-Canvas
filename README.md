# Air Canvas
 The Air Canvas project is an exciting application that combines computer vision technology with creativity. Let me provide you with an overview:  What is Air Canvas? Air Canvas (sometimes referred to as the Virtual Pen) is a cutting-edge project that leverages the power of OpenCV (an open-source computer vision library) to create an interactive sketching area. Its primary aim is to transform any ordinary surface (such as a screen or even the air) into an engaging canvas for drawing and painting. Key Features: Gesture-Based Drawing: Air Canvas allows users to draw and paint using hand gestures captured through a webcam. Real-Time Interaction: As you move your hand in front of the camera, the system interprets your gestures and translates them into drawing actions. Dynamic Interface: Users can switch colors, modify brush sizes, and control the canvas—all without touching any physical tools. How It Works: The project utilizes real-time image processing techniques. By detecting specific hand movements or colored objects (such as markers), Air Canvas enables users to create digital art without physical tools. Whether you’re drawing in the air or on a screen, the system captures your gestures and turns them into visual strokes. Applications: Air Canvas has applications in digital art, interactive installations, and educational settings. Artists, designers, and educators can explore new ways of creating and engaging with visual content.
